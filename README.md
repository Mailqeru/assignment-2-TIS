## My Reflection  
The industrial talk by Clarity Techworks serves as a valuable source of information. Among them are offering a comprehensive understanding of the industry, career paths, and the company's work enviroment. The advice provided by the speakers is likely to motivate and guide students in their pursuit of successful ICT careers. This is also an encouragement to me about my career in the future. I also became less worried about my career. It also made me as a person more confident about the course I took. Apart from that, it also made me to know more about programming language. This is because in order to create a system it is necessary to understand the matter so that it will be easy in the future. I also hope to be able to create something like they did and be successful.
